## How do I use this workflow?

### Inputs

All Get actions have multiple input options. Only 1 is required to return data.

### Outputs

All actions return data as taskname.results.output. Within the output is a message and data objects. 

### Triggers

All actions are designed to be used as subworkflows.

### Dragons

Failures will appear to pass but will contain error information within the standard output.<br />
For Security purposes edit the Cove Backup - Auth workflow and redact the body of the Cove_Auth action to prevent leaking your API key.
